To enable searching, you will have to initiate indexing of the site once it is installed on the actual server.


STEP 1:  modify config.php

The search engine is found under the folder digg.  Inside this directory, edit the file named config.php

The following variables needs to be assigned the actual address of the site.  Currently it is set to point to a local host setup as we were testing it. 


$base_url = " http://localhost/beancastle.net/hitech%20web/"; 


 
# Starting URL (used by spider)

$start_url = array(

"http://localhost/beancastle.net/hitech%20web/ ",

);

 

# Spider will index only files from these servers

$allow_url = array(

"http://localhost/beancastle.net/hitech%20web/ ",

);  



STEP 2:  Start indexing

To start indexing the site, use your browser to access the ff. address (replace www.yourwebsite.com with the actual URL):  http://www.yourwebsite.com/digg/spider.php 
This will automatically start the indexing process.  Once done, you can now use the search function.


NOTE:  This Zipped copy of the beancastle.zip site is not yet indexed… so please run the reindexing procedure
