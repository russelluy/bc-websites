                        Freight Terminal Pickup</span></p>
                      <p>We're often asked &quot;what is a freight terminal?&quot; Freight terminals are points we ship to in your region. They are large warehouses where products are staged for shipping to local addresses. There are two ways you can handle this method of freight. If you have a large enough vehicle such as a pickup truck or van, the freight guys will simply load the entire pallet onto your vehicle with a forklift away from the warehouse in the parking areas. If the pallet cannot fit, they will place it next to your vehicle where you will be responsible for loading the boxes into the vehicle.</p>
                      <p>Business Deliveries</p>
                      <p>If you should happen to own a business, or know someone that owns a business, we can ship there for the same rate as shipping to a freight terminal. These businesses must be in a commercial area, and not work out of the home type. They must also be open during regular business hours with someone able and available to receive the flooring. These types of deliveries are similar to residential if no forklift is available. The drivers will assist in handing down the boxes from the truck where you will be responsible for it from there. For these types of deliveries the freight company does not call to schedule times.</p>
                      <p>Weights and Sizes</p>
                      <p>Most pallets are 40&quot; to 48&quot; in width. The length will generally be dictated by the lengths shown on the individual product pages shown on our website. For example if it says 11&quot;- 55&quot; random length, the boxes will be approximately 55&quot; in length. Height and width of the boxes? For engineered hardwoods expect 2&quot; to 3&quot; in height. Width can vary from 5&quot; to 15&quot; depending on the product selected. Solid hardwoods will measure approximately 5&quot;- 8&quot; in width and 3&quot; to 4&quot; in height.</p>
                      <p>Weights of the boxes? All manufacturers are different. A good ballpark number to work with would be approximately 1.5 pounds per square foot for engineered hardwoods. Solid domestic(oak, maple, walnut etc) 3/4&quot; hardwoods weigh in at 2.8 pounds, while exotic hardwoods weigh 3.8 pounds per square foot. For thinner 5/16&quot; solid hardwoods use 1.5 pounds and 2.0 pounds for 7/16&quot; or 3/8&quot; thickness.</p>
                      <p>Count Everything Twice!</p>
                      <p>When a shipment is received, count everything with our checklist and the delivery receipt that will be provided from the trucking company during delivery or pickup. Make sure the number of boxes and other accessories have been received. In many cases transition (trim molding) pieces may be separate of the flooring pallet and packaged different. It is not necessary to open boxes of flooring, but make sure the product description matches with what you have ordered. Transition pieces are generally shipped in boxes or round cardboard tubes ranging in length of 72&quot; to 96&quot; Widths or diameter average 3 or four inches. It is vital you open each one and compare to our checklist assuring you have received the correct ones. Opening will require a box cutter or utility knife. Check each container making sure you have received the correct amount, color, and style. Refer to our checklist when receiving the order. Descriptions illustrations, and numbers will be provided. We cannot be held responsible for shortages after the shipment is signed for.</p>
                      <p>Freight Damage</p>
                      <p>It can happen. We can't promise everything will go like clock work and feel it's important to inform all of our customers what could happen. Having worked with many freight companies in the past and seeing damage that can happen first hand, we've found most of it to be one box or carton on the bottom of the pallet. Sometimes a forklift driver may misjudge picking it up and the forks hit the bottom. Often only one or two pieces are damaged. How often does this happen? An accurate and honest answer is less than 2% of the time. Don't be alarmed if this happens to you! The damage affects six to seven inches on a few pieces and should not be a concern. </p>
                      <p>What's not covered under freight damage? Today's prefinished hardwood flooring is packaged in corrugated cardboard, and strapped with plastic bands. Tears, broken bands, scuffed, or rippled packaging is not considered damage. Freight damage is exclusive to actual damage of the hardwood flooring itself. Damage to one or two boxes is not considered a total loss. Often a few pieces are affected as up to as many as 30 pieces can be contained in one box of hardwood flooring depending on the product purchased. For damaged boxes we suggest opening them when you have it in your home to asses how much has been affected. Place all good pieces back in the original carton and don't open until the actual installation.</p>
                      <p>In the rare likelihood of freight damage, or items that have not been received, you must note it on the delivery receipt before you are finished receiving the shipment. Don't rely on the driver making notes. You must be specific. We cannot be held responsible for damage or shortages after the shipment is signed for.</p>
                      <p>Notify us immediately of any freight damage or missing items. Even though you've made your notes while signing for the items, freight companies don't tell us about it. It will be your responsibility to contact us immediately to expedite any replacements. In the rare case of damaged freight, we also require taking digital pictures and send them to us as soon as possible. The more information we receive, the quicker replacements will be on their way. Without written documentation of damaged freight or missing items we cannot proceed with any claims or replacements.</p>
                      <p>Returns</p>
                      <p>It's always a good idea to have extra inventory on hand should you need it for a repair at a later date. Prefinished manufacturers discontinue lines from time to time or change the style which creates problems trying to match. Often the only recourse is to replace an entire room if the product is not available.</p>
                      <p>Our policy for those wishing to return extras must do so within 30 days of placing the order. We do not accept returns under 100 square feet or lines that have been discontinued by the manufacturer. Only full unopened cartons/boxes are acceptable. You will be responsible for the freight when returning and a 25% restocking fee. All thresholds, trims and other moldings cannot be returned, along with adhesives and underlayment.</p>
                      <p>Cancelled Orders</p>
                      <p>Orders may be cancelled. However, those wishing to cancel orders after an order has been shipped will be responsible for all freight costs including a 25% restocking fee. Freight costs include shipment to you and back to the origin point. </p>
                      <p>Our Toll Free Number 1-866-593-9520</p>
                      <p>** Garages or other areas where the elements are unsatisfactory for our products should not be used for storage of hardwood flooring. Acclimation of material to the installation area should be considered as soon as possible.</p>
