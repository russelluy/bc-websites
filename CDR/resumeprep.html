                have brochures&#8230;you have a resume. That is your marketing 
                tool with which to get noticed and considered. Much like a brochure 
                is unlikely to get you a sale all by itself, so too a resume is 
                unlikely to get you a job all by itself; but a good one should 
                get you an interview in a properly targeted job search campaign 
                - the rest is up to you in person. By the way, Webster&#8217;s 
                College Dictionary defines the word campaign as: &#8220;a systematic 
                course of aggressive activities for some specific purpose&#8221;. 
                If you want the right position at the right time without the need 
                of a miracle, you will need to make a campaign out of your &#8220;job 
                search&#8221;. And, we would strongly suggest that good organizational 
                skills might also pay off. Keep track of 1) Name of companies 
                you sent your resume 2) Position title 3) When you should follow 
                up and how? Etc? YES, Follow up! If you are in sales or marketing 
                you know the importance of that task already.<br>

                  Place it at the top: Name, address, phone number, and email 
                  address Centered is the preferred format but left justified 
                  is also acceptable.<br>
                  <span class="caption2">Objectives</span><br>
                  Write an objective using general terms if you plan to post your 
                  resume for keyword search so that you do not limit your possibilities. 
                  However, if you are submitting the resume for a specific position, 
                  then do customize it to speak to the job to which you are applying.<br>

                  the particular position for which you are applying (YES, you 
                  should slightly customize your resume to highlight the skills 
                  you already have that are a match to the position in which you

                  I n a chronological sequence with your most current employer 
                  first. List, in bold, Company Name, City and State, then on 
                  the far right list your start and end dates by year (save the 
                  month and year info for job applications). Be sure to give a 
                  condensed description of your accomplishments, especially if 
                  you received awards. Quantitative and Qualitative information 
                  is also very helpful in distinguishing yourself from others 
                  - your competition (e.g. exceeded annual quota by 23% for 3 
                  consecutive years). Don&#8217;t hesitate to mention large accounts 
                  (Corporate or Retail) you may have worked with in the past. 
                  Remember that in today&#8217;s world of search engines and keyword 
                  searches you have to think differently to be noticed more.<br>
                  <span class="caption2">Education</span><br>
                  Include type of degree(s) earned and the name of the institution 
                  (include city and state if you prefer). Don&#8217;t forget any 
                  special training you may have received should be listed here 
                  as well (Dale Carnegie, Tom Hopkins, Toastmasters, etc&#8230;)<br>

                  <span class="caption2">Salary Information</span><br>
                  While you should no list them on your resume, go ahead and state 
                  that they are available upon request and include what kind if 
                  you think it will get attention: Employer/CEO, Fortune 500 customers, 
                  etc&#8230;</p>

              <blockquote> 
                <p class="bodytext"><span class="caption2">Personal Information</span><br>
                  Federal law prohibits employers from asking about age, race, 
                  religion, gender, marital status, and political persuasion. 
                  An employer may be reluctant to interview a candidate who has 
                  included such information on his or her resume. Also, be careful 
                  giving other personal information such as hobbies and activities, 
                  you never know other people&#8217;s views on them.<br>
                  <span class="caption2">Objectives</span><br>
                  If you are asked to include this information when applying for 
                  a specific job, limit it to your cover letter. As a rule of 
                  thumb, do not put in on your resume and wait for the employer 
                  to raise the subject.</p>

              <p class="bodytext"><span class="caption1">Additional Tips</span></p>
              <blockquote> 
                <p class="bodytext">&#8226; With today&#8217;s technology, there 
                  is no excuse spelling and grammatical errors. In addition to 
                  relying on you computer, however, ask someone to proofread for 
                  errors. Computers are not yet capable of catching all errors.<br>
                  &#8226; A two pages resume is OK for Management/Executive position; 
                  otherwise keep it to one page. Be concise in your statements 
                  and save &#8220;the story&#8221; for the interview.<br>
                  &#8226; Use action verbs and industry-specific words to bring 
                  convey your skills and value that you bring (e.g. &#8221;made 
                  #1 Sales Rep of the year&#8221; is best worded as &#8220; Achieved 
                  #1 Sales Rep of the year&#8230;. Or Earned #1 Sales Rep of the 
                  year)<br>
                  &#8226; Be honest and realistic in preparing your resume. A 
                  good interviewer (and certainly a good recruiter) will catch 
                  inconsistencies, etc. </p>
