                the 5 P&#8217;s: &#8220;Proper Preparation Prevents Poor Performance&#8221;. 
                It isn&#8217;t difficult to ask or find a web site address prior 
                to our interview to learn about the business and industry you 
                are considering for employment. If time allows, call and ask for 
                product brochures or company literature or even Annual Reports 
                if available. Besides, if you are applying for a sales position, 
                the interviewer (likely to be your next sales manager or VP of 
                Sales) will be impressed and reassured that he/she is considering 
                somone who prepares for presentations.</span><br>
                <br>
                Keep in mind that YOU are also interviewing the company you are 
                applying to. It has to be a fit for you as well, not just the 
                other way around. So, the more you know about them, the better 
                you will interview and the more confidence you will have when 
                you say YES, I accept the challenge.<br>
                <br>
                If you compiled your resume properly, it should have highlights 
                from your previous positions as they apply to the position you 
                are seeking. Be prepared to discuss those accomplishments quantitatively 
                and qualitatively. This is a must if you want to stand out from 
                the rest. DO NOT assume that the interviewer will ask; all interviewers 
                have their own personal style of conducting an interview and many 
                are not as savvy at the task as you might think.<br>
                <br>
                Good personal skills are always appreciated and in demand in today's 
                organizations; they are expected in sales and marketing related 
                positions. Remind yourself before every interview to present yourself 
                through your posture, gestures, facial expressions, eye contact, 
                choice of words, speed of speech, etc. exactly as you want to 
                be seen.<br>
                <br>
                What about attire? Though we have seen a change in it in recent 
                years, an interview is still an interview and you are better off 
                making an error on the conservative side. A professional suit 
                for men and women is still the best choice for positions in sales 
                and marketing. If you are unsure as to how formal or contemporary, 
                you can always call anonymously into the company and ask someone 
                to guide you as to the corporate environment. Keep in mind, however, 
                that you are asking for an opinion.</p>
              <p class="caption1">Additional Tips</p>
              <blockquote> 
                <p class="bodytext">&#8226; If you have not interviewed in a while, 
                  be aware that you will get better with practice. But, you may 
                  want to rehearse with a friend since the position of choice 
                  may very well be the first or second company you apply to.<br>
                  &#8226; Never interrupt the interviewer and always wait for 
                  him/her to finish the question. It isn&#8217;t just a matter 
                  of courtesy, it will prevent you answering the wrong question<br>
                  &#8226; Don&#8217;t ask just good questions (your competition 
                  will do that too) ask great questions. And, since you are in 
                  a sales related position, ask questions as if you were speaking 
                  to a client, each one bringing you nearer to the close. Use 
                  questions such as: When can we meet again or who will I meet 
                  with next and when would be a good time? How do my qualifications 
                  compare with other candidates&#8217;?<br>
                  &#8226; When the time is right and if the interview went well, 
                  don&#8217;t forget to Ask for the Job just as you would ask 
                  for the order after a sales presentation! <br>
                  &#8226; Don&#8217;t forget to thank the interviewer for his/her 
                  time and consideration and then do something most people forget 
                  to do (even in sales), send a Thank You note even if you are 
                  not too sure you did very well.
