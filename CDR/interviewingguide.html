              <p class="bodytext"><span class="caption2">Hiring the right individual 
                for the position is one of the most crucial decisions you can 
                make in helping you company or business grow properly. That being 
                said, it is a challenging task to match a prospective candidate 
                with the job but it is a worthwhile investment of time and effort. 
                To ensure that you hire the most qualified individuals consider 
                the following tips:</span><br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make a list of questions ahead of time that 
                you wish to ask about the candidate&#8217;s resume. Use open-ended 
                questions (those that prevent YES or NO answer but require an 
                explanation).<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always do your best o make the candidates feel 
                comfortable; after all, they are still your guests.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be sure you are clear on the requirements, especially 
                the most crucial ones and that you can convey them clearly.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure you are and remain in control of the 
                interview, but allow the candidate to ask questions, especially 
                after the interview.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Develop and ask interview questions that effectively 
                determine the presence or absence of a skill. This task can be 
                left up a second interviewer who may be more familiar with the 
                specific skills required for a given position.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the interview is to screen job 
                candidates and predict the candidate&#8217;s success if employed. 
                Keep in mind an old rule of thumb: &#8220;the best predictor of 
                the future is the past&#8221;. Specific questions that probe deeper 
                their past experience can reveal potential areas of concern; however, 
                they often reveal positive information that the candidate may 
                have inadvertently left out or felt was not pertinent to the position.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don&#8217;t use your interview as the sole criterion 
                for selection or rejection. A second interviewer can be of great 
                help, especially if they are closer to the position requirements. 
                Also, the appropriate test can divulge information about an individual&#8217;s 
                work ethics, sales skills, etc&#8230; There are many I the market 
                with several of them providing for a strong &#8220;second opinion&#8221;.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never discard the importance of understanding 
                the candidate as a person. There are many personal qualities that 
                may transfer directly and positively into job skills and the right 
                as well as appropriate questions can help you determine if there 
                is a fit. *<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be fair in your interviewing practices.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without being committal, close the interview 
                and let the candidate know when you will be in touch with a response.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the interview and while you memory 
                is fresh, make a few notes or edit the ones you took.<br>
