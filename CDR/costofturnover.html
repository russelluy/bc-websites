              <p class="bodytext">Hiring Managers often fail to realize that turnover 
                carries a huge price followed by enormous costs - some obvious, 
                others not so obvious.<br>
                <br>
                <span class="caption2">OBVIOUS</span><br>
                The actual price of hiring a replacement: advertising (newspaper 
                ads, internet ads, industry publications ads, etc&#8230;), recruiting 
                fees (these can be high depending on the position being filled 
                and if you should fall in the hands of the wrong recruiting firm).<br>
                <br>
                <span class="caption2">NOT SO OBVIOUS</span><span class="caption1"><br>
                </span>Time away from more revenue generating tasks: screening 
                time, interviewing time, reference and background checks, aptitude 
                testing, etc&#8230; What about the lost revenue from a territory 
                that is not being worked?<br>
                <br>
                <span class="caption2">OFTEN NOT OBVIOUS AT ALL</span><br>
                Low employee and department morale, possible litigation, unemployment 
                compensation, new candidates ask about turnover and develop the 
                wrong opinion of your business). Low productivity and poor customer 
                service prior to leaving can often occur months before it is detected. 
                This is especially costly when the &#8220;unhappy&#8221; individual 
                is in sales and should be generating revenues.<br>
